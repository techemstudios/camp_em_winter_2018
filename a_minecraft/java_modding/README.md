# Minecraft Modding with Java Instructions   

Currently this setup only works well on mac OS (minecraft forge env is too slow on windows). Since, we have a limited number of macs, students will have to pair up.  

### Setup Slides  

The instructions for attaining the tools necessary for creating and modifying mods using Minecraft Forge can be found in deck\index.html and in [pdf format](https://github.com/joetechem/minecraft-with-modding-camp/blob/master/lessons_and_materials/mc_modding_setup_slides.pdf).
